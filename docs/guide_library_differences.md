# Differences between ODE libraries

[<- back to README.md](..)

## Summary

Different goals and contents. [Boost.Odeint](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/numeric/odeint/doc/html/index.html) & [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) are much more suitable for heavyweight HPC tasks and are mainly focused on ODEs.

**GSE** is a convenient all-in-one package with matrices & linear algebra bundled in, useful for research work that needs quick iteration.

It also seems to be the only library (that I am aware of) to provide stochastic solvers.

> [!Note]
>
> **(1)** Subjective metrics.
>
> **(2)** Here "numerical differentiation" refers to differentiation as an independent API, differentiation as an implementation detail is present in all libraries due to its necessity in nonlinear solvers & stiff ODEs.
>
> **(3)** Compatibility is not documented but likely present in some form.
>
> **(4)** GSE requires a bit less setup to benefit from parallelism.
